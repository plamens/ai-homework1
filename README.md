A program that uses Alphaâ€“beta pruning to play a game of "domino islands".
Two players take turns placing domino tiles on a chessboard and the score for each player is calculated as the sum of the squared areas for each of the player's islands, i.e. the goal is to have one large island and force your opponent to split his tiles over two or more islands. The game ends when there are no free adjacent squares on the board, so it's not possible to place a tile.
